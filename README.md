💖 Do You Love Me? – Fun Interactive Web Page

This is a playful and interactive web project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It asks the ultimate question: "Do you love me?" — and gives users no choice but to say Yes! 😉

When the "No" button is hovered, it runs away randomly, making it impossible to click.
If the user clicks "Yes", a cute heart-loading animation appears, followed by a lovely success screen.

🚀 Features

🎥 Autoplaying GIF-style videos for interaction & response

😂 Annoying No Button that escapes when hovered

❤️ Heart Loader Animation before result

🌈 Fully responsive and smooth transition effects
